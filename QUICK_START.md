# MobileBayJubilee - Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your new iOS project created with Claude Dev Workflow!

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Create Xcode Project File

The directory structure is ready, but you need to create the .xcodeproj file:

**Option A: Create New Project in Xcode** (Recommended)
1. Open Xcode
2. File > New > Project
3. Select: iOS > App
4. Settings:
   - Product Name: `MobileBayJubilee`
   - Team: [Your Team]
   - Organization Identifier: [Your identifier]
   - Interface: SwiftUI
   - Storage: SwiftData
   - Language: Swift
   - Include Tests: Yes
5. **Important**: Save to `/Users/blake/Projects/MobileBayJubilee`
6. **Delete** the auto-generated files:
   - MobileBayJubilee/MobileBayJubileeApp.swift (use the one in App/ folder)
   - MobileBayJubilee/ContentView.swift (use the one in App/ folder)
   - MobileBayJubilee/Item.swift (if generated)
7. **Add** the existing source files to the project:
   - Right-click MobileBayJubilee group > Add Files
   - Add: App/, Models/, Views/, Stores/, Services/, Utilities/, Resources/

**Option B: Manual Setup** (Advanced)
- Create Xcode project configuration manually
- Add all source files and folders
- Configure build settings
- Set up test targets

---

### 2. Verify Project Builds

```bash
cd /Users/blake/Projects/MobileBayJubilee

# Build the project
xcodebuild -project MobileBayJubilee.xcodeproj \
  -scheme MobileBayJubilee \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  build

# Or in Xcode: Cmd+B
```

You should see "Ready to build! âœ…" when you run the app.

### 3. Review Workflow Documentation

Read these in order:

1. **`claude.md`** (at project root) (5-10 min)
   - Master workflow overview
   - Quick reference guide

2. **`docs/ios-development.md`** (10-15 min)
   - iOS technical standards
   - SwiftUI/SwiftData patterns
   - Code quality guidelines

3. **`docs/project-management.md`** (10 min)
   - Phase-based development
   - Task planning
   - Quality gates

4. **`docs/agent-deployment.md`** (10 min)
   - Multi-agent coordination
   - Role definitions
   - Team structures

---

### 4. Begin Phase 0 Planning

Use Zen tools to plan your project:

**Step 1: Project Breakdown**
```
Use Zen tool: planner

Input: "Plan iOS app: MobileBayJubilee
[Describe your app idea, target users, key features]"

Output: Detailed phase breakdown with tasks and dependencies
```

**Step 2: Architecture Planning**
```
Use Zen tool: thinkdeep

Input: "Design architecture for MobileBayJubilee
Requirements: [Your specific needs]"

Output: Architecture recommendations and decisions
```

**Step 3: Define Features**
- Create list of all features
- Prioritize as P0/P1/P2/P3
- Map to phases
- Update `tracking/phase-status.md`

---

### 5. Track Your Progress

Update these files regularly:

**`tracking/session-state.md`**
- Current work
- Decisions made
- Blockers
- Next steps

**`tracking/phase-status.md`**
- Task progress
- Completed items
- Timeline

**`tracking/mock-data-registry.md`**
- Mock data usage
- Migration plan

**`tracking/screenshots/`**
- Feature evidence
- Proof of completion

## ðŸ“š Essential Commands

### Build & Test
```bash
# Build
xcodebuild -project MobileBayJubilee.xcodeproj -scheme MobileBayJubilee build

# Test
xcodebuild test -project MobileBayJubilee.xcodeproj \
  -scheme MobileBayJubilee \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'

# Or in Xcode
# Build: Cmd+B
# Test: Cmd+U
# Run: Cmd+R
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit (after quality gates pass!)
git commit -m "Descriptive message"

# View history
git log --oneline
```
