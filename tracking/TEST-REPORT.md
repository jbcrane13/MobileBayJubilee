- ✅ Empty messages cannot be sent
- ✅ Long messages can be sent successfully

**Total Tests**: 4 test methods
**Notes**: Tests use XCTSkip for features not yet implemented

---

#### 5. ReportVerificationUITests.swift
**Location**: `/Users/blake/Projects/MobileBayJubilee/MobileBayJubileeUITests/ReportVerificationUITests.swift`

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Tap verify button increments count
- ✅ Verify button changes visual state
- ✅ Multiple verify buttons work independently
- ✅ Verification count displays correctly
- ✅ Verified reports show verified badge
- ✅ Verification persists across navigation
- ✅ Verified filter shows only verified reports

**Total Tests**: 8 test methods (including 1 skipped for auth requirements)
**Notes**: Uses XCUITest framework for UI automation

---

## Build Status

### Initial Build
- **Status**: ✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED (for testing)
- **Warnings**: 11 Sendable warnings (Swift 6 compatibility - non-blocking)
- **Errors**: 0

### Test Execution Status
Tests are ready to run once:
1. RealFirebaseService fully implements all protocol methods
2. ChatView dependencies are resolved
3. Services (ReputationManager, AlertLevelManager, ConditionScoreService) are implemented by Feature Dev agents

---

## Test Coverage Targets

### Current Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 48 test methods across 3 service test files
- **UI Tests**: 12 test methods across 2 UI test files
- **Total**: 60 test methods

### Expected Coverage
- **Target**: 70% code coverage minimum for services
- **Strategy**: Tests are designed to cover all major code paths and edge cases

---

## Mock Services Included

All unit tests include mock implementations that can be used for testing before real services are implemented:

1. **ReputationManager** (mock class included in test file)
   - calculateReputationChange()
   - qualifiesForVerifiedWatcher()

2. **AlertLevelManager** (mock class included in test file)
   - calculateAlertLevel()
   - Time window filtering

3. **ConditionScoreService** (mock class included in test file)
   - calculateConditionScore()
   - Seasonal, time window, wind, tide, and water quality scoring

---

## Next Steps

### For Feature Development Agents
1. Implement real ReputationManager service
2. Implement real AlertLevelManager service
3. Implement real ConditionScoreService
4. Ensure all services match the test expectations

### For Testing Agent (Future)
1. Run full test suite once services are implemented
2. Generate code coverage report
3. Add integration tests for Firebase interactions
4. Add performance tests for scoring algorithms

---

## Test Execution Commands

### Run All Unit Tests
```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project MobileBayJubilee.xcodeproj \
  -scheme MobileBayJubilee \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro Max' \
  -only-testing:MobileBayJubileeTests
```

### Run All UI Tests
```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project MobileBayJubilee.xcodeproj \
  -scheme MobileBayJubilee \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro Max' \
  -only-testing:MobileBayJubileeUITests
```

### Generate Coverage Report
```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project MobileBayJubilee.xcodeproj \

## Test Quality Assurance

### Test Principles Applied
- ✅ Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- ✅ Descriptive test names
- ✅ Isolated test cases (no dependencies between tests)
- ✅ Edge case coverage
- ✅ Boundary value testing
- ✅ Positive and negative test scenarios

### Code Quality
- ✅ Clear test documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive assertions
- ✅ Mock data for repeatability
- ✅ XCTSkip for unimplemented features
- ✅ Timeout handling for async operations

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Blockers
1. **Main App Build**: RealFirebaseService needs chat method stubs (RESOLVED by Testing Agent)
2. **Service Implementation**: Core services not yet implemented by Feature Dev agents
3. **UI Features**: Chat and verification UI not fully implemented

### Future Enhancements
1. Integration tests with real Firebase emulator
2. Performance benchmarks for scoring algorithms
3. Screenshot tests for UI consistency
4. Accessibility tests (VoiceOver support)

---

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ **ALL TESTS CREATED AND READY**

The test suite is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for execution. Once the Feature Development Agents complete their service implementations, these tests will provide:

- Immediate feedback on correctness
- Regression prevention
- Documentation of expected behavior
- Confidence in production readiness

**Next Action**: Feature Development Agents should implement services matching test specifications, then Testing Agent can run the full suite and generate coverage reports.
