## Phase 0 Success Criteria

Before moving to Phase 1, ALL of these must be complete:
- [ ] All critical APIs validated and accessible
- [ ] Water quality sensor status confirmed (with fallback if unavailable)
- [ ] Backend architecture chosen and scaffolded
- [ ] Xcode project initialized with core data models
- [ ] Legal documents approved and ready
- [ ] Design system complete with all key screens mocked
- [ ] Detailed Phase 1 plan finalized
- [ ] Mock data strategy documented

## Critical Decisions Needed

### IMMEDIATE (This Week)
1. BUDGET ALIGNMENT: $162k required vs $74k PRD estimate (88k gap)
   - Options: Increase budget, reduce scope, reduce team, or delay launch
   - Stakeholder decision required

### Week 1-2 (When Team Starts)
2. NOAA SENSOR VALIDATION: Do water quality sensors exist? (BLOCKING)
3. BACKEND PLATFORM CHOICE: Firebase vs AWS (Week 2-3)

---

## Next Steps

### This Week (Immediate)
1. Update tracking/session-state.md
2. Initialize Xcode project structure
3. Set up mock data registry
4. Document critical decisions in CRITICAL-DECISIONS.md

### When Phase 0 Team Starts (November 2025)
1. Backend Lead: Start NOAA sensor validation (BLOCKING)
2. Product Manager: Schedule stakeholder budget meeting
3. Backend Lead + PM: Begin architecture evaluation
