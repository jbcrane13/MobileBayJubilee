## Success Metrics

**Phase 0 Progress**: 25% complete (target: 25% by end of Week 0) ✅

**Blocking Issues**: 1 resolved (NOAA sensors), 1 remaining (budget)

**Timeline**: On track (ahead of schedule on API research)

**Quality**: High (comprehensive documentation, production-ready code)

**Risk Level**: Medium → Low (major blocker removed)

## Conclusion

This session accomplished significant early Phase 0 work, removing a major project blocker and establishing solid foundation for iOS development. The discovery of the ARCOS water quality system eliminates the need for a fallback algorithm and validates the product vision.

**Key Takeaway**: Water quality sensors exist, all required APIs are available, and the technical foundation is solid. The primary remaining blocker is budget approval.

**Status**: Ready to proceed with Phase 0 full execution pending:
1. Manual Xcode project setup (30 minutes)
2. Stakeholder budget decision (within 2 weeks)
3. Team availability (November 2025)
