## 3. Water Quality Sensors - ARCOS System (CRITICAL FINDING)

### Overview
**ARCOS (Alabama Real-time Coastal Observing System)** operated by Dauphin Island Sea Lab provides real-time water quality data for Mobile Bay.

### CRITICAL FINDING
**Water quality sensors DO EXIST** in Mobile Bay. The PRD concern about sensor availability is RESOLVED.

### System Details
- Operator: Dauphin Island Sea Lab
- Network: 7 water quality sampling stations around Mobile Bay + 1 outside Bay entrance
- Update Frequency: Every 30 minutes
- Data History: Continuous sampling from 2003 to present

### Data Portal
```
https://arcos.disl.org
```

### Available Parameters (Critical for Condition Score)
- **Water Temperature** (°C)
- **Salinity** (PSU - Practical Salinity Units)
- **Dissolved Oxygen** (mg/L) - Bonus for jubilee correlation
- Water Height/Depth
- Turbidity
- Chlorophyll concentration

### Station Locations (7 around Mobile Bay)
Stations located strategically around Mobile Bay to capture spatial variation. Specific coordinates and station IDs to be confirmed via ARCOS website.

**Expected Coverage**:
- Point Clear area
- Fairhope area
- Daphne area
- Mobile River delta
- Bay entrance
- Eastern Shore locations

### NOAA Integration
NOAA also operates the **Mobile Bay PORTS® (Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System)** with 19 stations providing:
- Water level observations
- Meteorological forecasts
- Marine channel forecasts

Mobile Bay Marine Channels Forecast: https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/ngofs2/mbmcf.html

### API Access
**To Be Determined by Backend Team**:
- Check if ARCOS provides API access (website suggests downloadable data)
- May require partnership or data sharing agreement with Dauphin Island Sea Lab
- Alternative: Web scraping (if permitted) or periodic data file downloads
- Backup: Use NOAA Mobile Bay PORTS data if available via CO-OPS API

### Update Frequency
Every 30 minutes - Suitable for 15-minute cron job with interpolation

### Data Availability
- Real-time: Current readings
- Historical: Data archive from 2003 to present (excellent for validation and pattern analysis)

### Cost
Likely **Free** for non-commercial/research use, but confirm with Dauphin Island Sea Lab

### Status
**Available** - Resolves critical P0-001a concern about sensor availability

### Recommendation
1. Backend team contacts Dauphin Island Sea Lab to request API access or data sharing agreement
2. If API unavailable, implement periodic data file parsing
3. Use ARCOS data for salinity and water temperature in Condition Score algorithm
4. Proceed with full algorithm as designed (no fallback needed)

---

## 4. OpenWeather API (Backup Weather Source)

### Overview
Commercial weather API as backup/supplement to NOAA Weather Service.

### API Endpoint
```
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
```

### Documentation
https://openweathermap.org/api

### Available Data
- Current weather
- Forecasts (hourly, daily, 5-day, etc.)
- Historical weather data
- Air quality, UV index, etc.

### Example API Call
```
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?
  lat=30.4085&
  lon=-87.8872&
  appid={API_KEY}&
  units=imperial
```

### Rate Limits (Free Tier)
- 1,000 calls/day
- 60 calls/minute
- Free tier suitable for development and testing

### Cost
- Free tier: $0 (1,000 calls/day)
- Startup plan: $40/month (100,000 calls/month) if needed

### When to Use
- Backup if NOAA Weather Service API is down
- Development/testing to avoid hitting NOAA during rapid iteration
- Future premium features (UV index, air quality, etc.)

### Status
**Available as Backup** - Recommend using NOAA as primary source

---

## Integration Architecture Recommendations

### Data Aggregation Strategy

**Cron Job (Backend - Every 15 Minutes)**:
```
1. Fetch NOAA Tide Data (current tide phase, next high/low)
   - Endpoint: api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov
   - Cache: 1 hour (tide predictions don't change frequently)

2. Fetch NOAA Weather Data (wind, temperature, weather pattern)
   - Endpoint: api.weather.gov
   - Cache: 15 minutes

3. Fetch ARCOS Water Quality Data (salinity, water temperature)
   - Endpoint: arcos.disl.org (method TBD)
   - Cache: 30 minutes (matches ARCOS update frequency)

4. Calculate Condition Score using aggregated data

5. Store in database:
   - Current score
   - Component scores
   - Raw environmental data
   - Timestamp

6. Check user notification thresholds

7. Send push notifications if thresholds met
```

### API Response Time Targets
- NOAA Tides API: <2 seconds
- NOAA Weather API: <2 seconds
- ARCOS Data: <3 seconds (depends on access method)
- Total aggregation time: <10 seconds
- Unified API response to iOS app: <1 second (from cached data)

### Error Handling
- If NOAA Tides fails: Use last cached value, mark as stale
- If NOAA Weather fails: Fall back to OpenWeather API
- If ARCOS fails: Omit water quality from score, reduce max score to ~85
- If all fail: Return error, use last known good data with staleness warning

### Data Freshness
- Condition Score recalculated every 15 minutes
- iOS app pulls on launch and every 5-10 minutes if user is active
- Offline mode: Show last cached score with timestamp

## Next Steps - Backend Team Actions

### Immediate (Week 1 of Phase 0)
1. **Confirm Mobile Bay NOAA Tide Station IDs**
   - Visit https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/tide_predictions.html?gid=1392
   - Identify stations for Point Clear, Fairhope, Daphne, Mobile Bay
   - Test API calls with actual station IDs
   - Document station IDs in codebase

2. **Test NOAA Weather API for Mobile Bay**
   - Get grid point for Eastern Shore coordinates
   - Test observation and forecast endpoints
   - Verify wind speed/direction data availability
   - Document API response structure

3. **Contact Dauphin Island Sea Lab (ARCOS)**
   - Email: arcos@disl.org (likely contact)
   - Request:
     - API access if available
     - Data sharing agreement for non-commercial use
     - Real-time data feed options
     - Historical data access for validation
   - Alternative: Investigate data file download options
   - Timeline: Allow 1-2 weeks for response

4. **Create Test API Integration**
   - Build simple Node.js script to test all three APIs
   - Fetch real data from Mobile Bay area
   - Verify data quality and completeness
   - Test error handling (simulate API failures)
   - Document response schemas

5. **Register OpenWeather API Key**
   - Create free tier account at openweathermap.org
   - Get API key for backup weather data
   - Test API with Mobile Bay coordinates
   - Store API key securely in environment variables

### Week 2-3 (Backend Infrastructure Setup)

   - Set up 15-minute scheduled function (Firebase/AWS)
   - Implement parallel API fetching
   - Build Condition Score calculation engine
   - Store results in Firestore/DynamoDB

7. **Create Unified API Endpoint**
   - GET /api/conditions
   - Returns: Current score, breakdown, environmental data, timestamp
   - Implements caching (serve from database, not live APIs)
   - Add rate limiting

8. **Integration Testing**
   - Test during different times of day
   - Verify score calculation accuracy
   - Monitor API reliability over 1 week
   - Load test (simulate 500 concurrent users)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- NOAA Tides API: Proven, reliable, well-documented
- NOAA Weather API: Official government API, free, no key required

### Medium Risk
- ARCOS Data Access: May require partnership agreement, API access uncertain
- API Reliability: All external dependencies, any can fail

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **ARCOS Backup Plan**: If API access denied, use Mobile Bay PORTS data from NOAA CO-OPS (may have fewer stations)
2. **Caching Strategy**: Always serve from cache, never directly from external APIs
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Disable failing APIs temporarily, continue with reduced data
4. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts if any API fails for >15 minutes
