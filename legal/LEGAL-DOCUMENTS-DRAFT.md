# Condition Score Disclaimer

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY**

## What is the Condition Score?

The Condition Score is a **numerical estimate (0-100)** indicating the likelihood that environmental conditions in Mobile Bay, Alabama, are favorable for a jubilee event to occur.

## How is it Calculated?

The score is calculated using an algorithm that considers:
- **Seasonal patterns** (time of year)
- **Time of day** (early morning hours)
- **Wind conditions** (speed and direction)
- **Tide phase** (low tide and tide movement)
- **Weather patterns** (temperature, recent storms)
- **Water quality** (salinity, water temperature, dissolved oxygen)

Data is sourced from:
- NOAA Tides & Currents
- NOAA National Weather Service
- ARCOS (Alabama Real-time Coastal Observing System)

## What the Condition Score IS NOT

❌ **NOT a prediction or forecast**
❌ **NOT a guarantee a jubilee will occur**
❌ **NOT scientifically peer-reviewed**
❌ **NOT based on comprehensive research**

## Limitations & Risks

**The Condition Score has significant limitations**:

1. **Jubilees are unpredictable**: Even with ideal conditions, a jubilee may not occur
2. **Algorithm may be inaccurate**: The scoring algorithm is based on historical patterns and may not account for all factors
3. **Data may be delayed or inaccurate**: Third-party data sources (NOAA, ARCOS) may have delays, outages, or errors
4. **Local variations**: Conditions vary across Mobile Bay; a high score in one area does not guarantee conditions elsewhere
5. **Unmodeled factors**: There may be unknown factors affecting jubilees that the algorithm does not consider

## Recommended Use

✅ **DO use the Condition Score as ONE factor** when deciding whether to check for jubilees
✅ **DO combine the score with other information** (community reports, local knowledge, personal observation)
✅ **DO verify conditions yourself** before acting

❌ **DO NOT rely solely on the Condition Score**
❌ **DO NOT make travel or fishing decisions based only on the score**
❌ **DO NOT assume a high score guarantees a jubilee**

## Disclaimer of Liability

**BY USING THE CONDITION SCORE FEATURE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE**:

1. Jubilee events are natural phenomena beyond our control
2. The Condition Score is provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind
3. We are NOT liable for:
   - Missed jubilee opportunities
   - Wasted time or expenses
   - Decisions made based on the score
   - Inaccuracies or errors in the score
   - Damages resulting from reliance on the score

**YOU ASSUME ALL RISK** when using the Condition Score for decision-making.

## Report Issues

If you notice the Condition Score appears inaccurate or if you experience a jubilee when the score was low (or vice versa), please report it to us. Your feedback helps improve the algorithm.
