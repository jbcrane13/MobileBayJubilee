JubileeHub is the essential app for Mobile Bay jubilee enthusiasts. Never miss a jubilee event again!

FEATURES:
• Real-Time Community Reports: See jubilee sightings as they happen
• Condition Score (0-100): AI-powered forecast of jubilee likelihood
• Interactive Map: View reports and webcam locations around the Bay
• Event Chat: Coordinate with other watchers during active events
• Push Notifications: Get alerted when conditions are favorable
• Photo Sharing: Document and share your jubilee experiences

WHAT IS A JUBILEE?
Mobile Bay jubilees are rare natural events where fish, crabs, and other marine life move to shallow water near shore, making them easy to harvest. They typically occur on summer mornings under specific environmental conditions.

CONDITION SCORE:
Our proprietary algorithm analyzes tide data, weather patterns, and water quality to calculate a daily Condition Score (0-100). Higher scores indicate conditions historically associated with jubilee events.

COMMUNITY-DRIVEN:
JubileeHub connects jubilee watchers across the Eastern Shore. Share sightings, view real-time reports, and chat with fellow enthusiasts.

DATA SOURCES:
• NOAA Tides & Currents
• NOAA National Weather Service
• ARCOS Water Quality Monitoring

IMPORTANT: The Condition Score is an estimate only. Jubilee events are unpredictable. Always verify conditions yourself and comply with Alabama fishing regulations.
